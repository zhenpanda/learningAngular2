How to use these files

Either use this Folder as a completely new Project (like the one in the NodeJS Installation Lecture) or just pick the files you want to replace in your own Project.

The most important Files/Folders (i.e. Files/Folders that changed) are the following:
/assets/*
/routes/*
/views/*
